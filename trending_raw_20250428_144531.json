                    "description": "Colin’s joined by John Middlekauff, host of “3 and Out” to recap the 2025 NFL Draft! They dissect the saga of Shedeur Sanders, why he turned off so many teams, and why the Browns selecting him feels like an “ownership pick.” They discuss why it was a “starter draft” not a “star” draft, why the Jaguars were completely fleeced for Travis Hunter, and why intelligence is the most important trait in a prospect. Finally they point to the Seahawks as the winners of the draft, debate whether the Rams had eyes on QB Jaxson Dart, and break down why Texas QB Quinn Ewers went from a first round prospect to seventh round selection.\n\nTimeline\n0:00 Shedeur Sanders storyline\n2:15 If a quarterback isn’t the starter, teams don’t want to deal with “noise”\n4:30 Shedeur turned teams off in predraft meetings\n8:00 Quarterbacks are held to a higher standard\n12:30 Shedeur isn’t a “bad guy”, but Deion didn’t help his cause\n14:45 Browns ownership forced the Shedeur pick\n18:00 Intangibles really matter\n20:30 It wasn’t a “star” draft, it was a “starter” draft\n25:15 Jaguars got fleeced on the Travis Hunter trade\n27:00 Being able to learn the playbook is as important as the physical traits\n29:15 Intelligence is the most important trait\n33:15 Seahawks had a great draft\n37:30 Rams weren’t going to draft Jaxon Dart\n40:30 Does the Rams picking a RB mean that Blake Corum is a bust?\n42:15 Rams and Browns moving down show they’re targeting QBs in 2026?\n45:00 Quinn Ewers went from 1st round prospect a year ago, to being drafted in the 7th\n48:00 SEC + Big Ten dominated\n\nFollow us on social media: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thevolumesports\nhttps://twitter.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thevolumesports\n\nLearn more about The Volume:\nhttps://www.thevolume.com\n\nGAMBLING PROBLEM?

                "description": "I finally connected my three giant ecosystem vivariums together, and the result was unbelievable. My long term plan had come to completion when my rainforest floor vivarium, canopy vivarium, and tropical wetlands vivarium became a single space, with shared animals freely able to cross over to the different habitats. I was shocked at what animals crossed over through the new cave tunnel bridge. Our rainforest ecosystem within glass has been forever changed. Hope you enjoy the Season 4 Finale of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

                    "description": "I finally connected my three giant ecosystem vivariums together, and the result was unbelievable. My long term plan had come to completion when my rainforest floor vivarium, canopy vivarium, and tropical wetlands vivarium became a single space, with shared animals freely able to cross over to the different habitats. I was shocked at what animals crossed over through the new cave tunnel bridge. Our rainforest ecosystem within glass has been forever changed. Hope you enjoy the Season 4 Finale of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!
